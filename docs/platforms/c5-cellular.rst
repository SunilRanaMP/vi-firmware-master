C5 Cellular
===========

The C5 Cellular device requires an OBD-II to DB9 Serial cable (which is included) in the
shipment. This requires the device to be attached elsewhere in the vehicle since it does
not plug directly into the port.

Users are required to supply their own SIM card. The SIM card is the Mini-SIM (2FF) size
that supports 3G GSM.

The C5 Cellular device also has it's own GPS signal which can be configured to be 
inserted into the OpenXC JSON data.
